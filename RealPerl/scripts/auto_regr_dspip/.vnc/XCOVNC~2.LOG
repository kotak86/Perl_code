X connection to :3.0 broken (explicit kill or server shutdown).
The application 'serverconfig' lost its connection to the display :3.0;
most likely the X server was shut down or you killed/destroyed
the application.
Can't find file /home/ankitko/.vnc/xcovnc4:3.pid
You'll have to kill the Xvnc process manually
